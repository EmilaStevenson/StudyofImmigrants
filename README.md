Talents, Skills and Education level of Immigrants to USA 

README

Immigration is a hot topic in today’s USA conversation. People have strong opinions about immigrants and their contribution or lack thereof to the USA economy and labor force. Also, there is a lot of negative rhetoric about the immigrant community. I want to dispel the myths from the facts based on data. 
The data I will use for my research is a sample of the American Community Survey which is part of the USA Census Bureau ( https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs). U.S Census Data for Social, Economic and Health Research. I downloaded the data from Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS-USA, University of Minnesota, www.ipums.org).

Scope of my study:

Talents, skills and level of education for recent immigrants

•	Individuals age group 18-65 that were born outside the USA or USA territories with citizenship rights 
o	The U.S. has five permanently inhabited territories: Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands in the Caribbean Sea; Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, in the western North Pacific Ocean's Mariana Islands, and American Samoa in the South Pacific Ocean.[note 6] About 3.6 million people in these territories are U.S. citizens,[2][3][4][5][6] and citizenship at birth is granted in four of the five territories (granted by Congress).[29][30][31][note 7] Citizenship at birth is not granted in American Samoa — American Samoa has about 32,000 non-citizen U.S. nationals (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territories_of_the_United_States)
