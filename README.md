Talents, Skills and Education level of Immigrants to USA 

Immigration is a hot topic in todayâ€™s USA conversation. People have strong opinions about immigrants and their contribution or lack thereof to the USA economy and labor force. Also, there is a lot of negative rhetoric about the immigrant use of social services. I want to dispel the myths from the facts based on data. 

The data I will use for my research is a sample of the American Community Survey which is part of the USA Census Bureau ( https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs). U.S Census Data for Social, Economic and Health Research. I downloaded the data from Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS-USA, University of Minnesota, www.ipums.org).
Scope of my study:
Talents, skills and level of education for recent immigrants
Individuals age group 18-65 that were born outside the USA and entered the USA in the 2000 and later?
Individuals age group 18-65 that were born outside the USA and entered the USA in the year 2018?
